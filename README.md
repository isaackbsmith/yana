## YANA - You Are Not Alone

## Reason
I started this project because I have always wanted to build a companion device.
Inspired by Baymax and Jarvis, I built this to help people someday.
It's not done, and I hope I'll come back and finish it.
But for now, I have decided to make it avaialable online.
An LLM integration would be a fine addition.

I hope I come back to this.

## Instructions (Batteries Included)
Read the code, setup is almost straight forward.


## Closure
Contributions are welcome.
